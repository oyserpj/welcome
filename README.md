# Welcome to Oystr Dev!

We are a team of developers dedicated to the development and maintenance of a private Minecraft server and its Discord bot. As a company, we only have private repositories, so to access our code, you'll need to be part of our team.

## What we do

Our main focus is on creating an exceptional Minecraft experience for our players. Our team is constantly working on improving the server's performance, adding new features, and fixing bugs.

In addition, we have developed a Discord bot that is integrated with our server. The bot helps players interact with the server and each other, making the gaming experience more enjoyable.

## Accessing our code

Due to the private nature of our repositories, we are not currently seeking new team members. However, if you're interested in our development process, please feel free to reach out to us via Discord @mean.ing#0697. We're happy to answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for considering Oystr Dev, and we hope to hear from you soon.
